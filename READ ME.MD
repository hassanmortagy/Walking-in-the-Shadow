# Walking in the Shadow: A New Perspective on Descent Directions for Constrained Minimization Code

---

## Requirements:
* This code requires the aeroplane_data_small.mat data set, which is included in the zip file and could also be downloaded at https://github.com/Simon-Lacoste-Julien/linearFW
* This code also requires Gurobi (with a valid license) to be installed to the python environment used - this could be done at https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/quickstart_mac/the_grb_python_interface_f.html

## The complete code with explanantions is given in the Jupyter Notebook file:   
*Walking_in_the_shadow_code.ipynb*


## We also provide separate python files for each experiment for convenience:
* To run the video - co-localization experiment:  
*python video-co-localization.py*<br/><br/>

* To run the Lasso Regression (small instance) Experiment:  
*python lasso_regression_small.py*<br/><br/>

* To run the Lasso Regression (large instance) Experiment:  
*python lasso_regression_large.py*<br/><br/>
